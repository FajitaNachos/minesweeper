minesweeper
===========

Oh, Minesweeper. We had a good run there for a while didn't we...

This repo contains the source of a Minesweeper game that I made when applying for a job at [Thumbtack][http://www.thumbtack.com/challenges]. There were a few design contraints:

  *  I could use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (libraries like JQuery or Angular were welcomed). 

  *  The board needed to be an 8x8 grid with 10 mines randomly placed on the board

  *  The UI also needed the following features:

    -  New Game: It's exactly what it sounds like. :) 

    -  Validate: This checks that the only remaining tiles on the board contain mines. If so, win, if not, lose. 

    -  Cheat: I could show the user the location of the mines, in any way I wanted, provided that the game still continued. 


The total time on this was supposed to be a couple hours. I went over that, but I also spent some time learning about object oriented Javascript. Anway, had a blast making it. If you want to play, head over to my [my blog][http://fajitanachos.com/Minesweeper].
